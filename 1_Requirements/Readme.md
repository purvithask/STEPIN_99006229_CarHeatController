# INTRODUCTION

The automotive heating application provides vehicle to keep passenger warm while the surrounding temperatures are cold. The conventional heating system uses the heat loss produced by ICE, which is transferred to the cooling system and then used for heating the vehicle interior air. This ensures the passenger’s thermal comfort.

# FEATURES

A seat heater is a pad or a cushion that encompasses an electric heating system which boosts up surface temperature of the automotive seat at the will of the driver. 
Some of the key components of automotive seat heaters include heating element, resistor, relay and thermostat. 
Seat heaters are either available as internally integrated underneath the seat, which is also called heated seat, or as an external device in the form of pad or cushion.
 
# SWOT analysis

* STRENGTH
   - It is possible to warm seats very homogeneously so that a comfortable heat temperature is achieved after a heating phase.
   - No differences in temperature arise that could be felt on the seat. 
   
* WEAKNESS
   - Unfortunately, do not allow this condition to be achieved quickly due to limitations of the heater's overall power requirements. 
   - The seat's thermal connection with the passenger additionally creates the basic problem of the passenger contributing to the warming process of the cold seat in the initial        phase to a relatively large extent and thus reinforcing the perception of coldness.
   
* OPPORTUNITY
   - The heat producing condition to be achieved quickly to provide passenger’s thermal comfort.

* THREATS
   - The problem of the delayed warming process can certainly be described as the largest weakness of existing seat heaters.
   - Since the need for a seat heater is directly connected to the fact that the seat should warm up faster, from heat made available by the motor, compared to the much slower          warming of the vehicle's interior.

# 4W’s and 1H

* What: Automotive heat controller
* Where: Used in automotive industry
* When: When the surrounding temperature is low. When passenger required warmth.
* Why: To keep surrounding (inside vehicle) warm during cold condition
* How: by monitoring heat control system
